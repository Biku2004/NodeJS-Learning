We can divide a function into parts(modules) and use the function by using the require function 
from the JS to import the modules and use them.

But we have to export the following function first to make them import
using module.export = "function name" (Inside the function File)

But if we have multiple function in the same file and we want to export it we using objects to do it
module.export = {
    add,sub (function name)

        OR
    addFun : add
}
